Allows the user to call random quotes with the quote_this() function, [quote-this] shortcode, or Quote This widget.

== Description ==

*Quote This* is yet another quote plugin.  It has been a script I've used on my personal blog for a few years that I figured I'd share with the rest of the WordPress community.

Basically, it lets you show quotations on your blog in one of three ways:

* `quote_this()` template tag for your theme template files.
* `[quote-this]` shortcode for adding it to your posts and pages.
* <em>Quote This</em> widget for use in widget areas.

== Installation ==

1. Uzip the `quote-this.zip` folder.
1. Upload the `quote-this` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins` directory.
1. In your WordPress dashboard, head over to the *Plugins* section.
1. Activate *Quote This*.

More detailed instructions are included in the plugin's `readme.html` file.

`
<?php if ( function_exists( 'quote_this' ) ) quote_this(); ?>
`

`
[quote-this]
`
